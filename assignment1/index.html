      <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
      <p><span class= "clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>
      <p>The cave residents observe a strange shape—a box-like construction with a rectangular line running through it. <span class= "clickable" id="first-change">They watch as the rectangular and box-like shapes begin to move.</span> The shapes move strangely, appearing to beat themselves against an imagined box, attempting to escape but becoming caught. This seems significant to the individuals in the cave—an attempt to break free from invisible restraints. Despite the lack of physical obstacles, the shape's futile attempts to escape symbolize the residents' internal conflicts, their brains preventing them from obtaining genuine freedom. <span class= "clickable" id="second-change">As the shape's movements get more chaotic,</span> it transitions between shapes, going from a box to a hexagon in an instant and back again. The shape, according to the residents in the cave, has its mind and represents its difficulties. The shape's darkness reflects the darkness within individuals, while the box reflects their inner selves. The rectangle's ongoing alteration indicates development and growth, even during internal upheaval.
      </p>
      <p>Nick Sousanis' concept of Flatness proposes that we frequently observe only one perspective that we consider accurate, such as the idea that the planet is flat, grass is green, or horses eat carrots. However, seeing merely one side does not imply that it represents the complete truth. Flatness represents a limited view of a larger reality in which people accept truths given by others without personally experiencing them. This theory is consistent with the beliefs of the people in the cave, who believe in the "all-seeing eye" they see—a box-like shape moving up and down within a box, finally transforming into an "all-seeing eye" that protects them.Their limited perspective prevents them from comprehending the entire reality. Unbeknownst to them, the shape has always been an eye, rotating and hovering in multiple directions rather than moving in a single direction. They are not aware that their perception is not wholly accurate.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Seeing double</h2>
      <p><span class= "clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>
      <p>Outside the cave, people interpret the "all-seeing eye" in an entirely different way. Those inside the cave believe the eye is continually watching over them, whilst those outside see the protective barrier surrounding the eye as stationary and revolving, with the physical eye inside the boundary moving back and forth. <span class= "clickable" id="third-change">The folks outside the cave are surprised when the eye starts to move up and down.</span> Until now, they thought the eye was immobile. People inside the cave had incorrectly imagined the eye was moving, whereas those outside now see the eye's physical movement and interpret it as a second waking or a sign of enlightenment. <span class= "clickable" id="fourth-change">As the eye beevolvesapidly, panic spreads among the people outside the cave.</span> They are perplexed by the eye's unexpected movement and think it could explode due to overstimulation from its newfound understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of seeing double relates to a single absolute thing viewed in two distinct ways. This indicates that while there is only one reality, multiple perspectives and interpretations can exist. In the "all-seeing eye narrative," those within and outside the cave experience the shape/eye's movement up and down in different ways. While the cave dwellers see the shadow of the rotating object and assume it is moving, those outside notice the physical movement of the eye. These two universes are linked by the same experience of seeing the same item, yet interpreted differently. Regardless of variances in perception, the reality is that the thing is moving, emphasizing the complexity of truth and perspective. An example of “seeing double” in the context of a water bottle would be me saying it’s half full while my friend says it’s half empty. Both of us are right, but we have different perspectives. The only thing that has changed is our interpretation of the bottle having half its contents left.
